If you want, I can also generate:

✅ A **JSON + Markdown hybrid**
✅ A **CSV file** for Google Sheets / Excel
✅ A **ranked list (top 10)** by capability
or
✅ A **diagram grouping these by use-case (agents, autocomplete, testing, etc.)**

Just tell me!


Here is **one clean JSON file** containing **all 50 generative-AI tools**, each with:

* `name`
* `category`
* `description`
* `url`

You can copy/paste this directly into a `.json` file.
