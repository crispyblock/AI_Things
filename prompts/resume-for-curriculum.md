# 🛡️ **Cloud Security & DevSecOps Skills Summary**

**Cloud Platforms:**

* AWS (ECR, ECS, EKS, IAM, VPC, Security Groups, KMS, Secrets Manager, CloudWatch)

**Containerization & Security:**

* Docker & Podman (rootless mode, hardened Dockerfiles, CIS Benchmark)
* Image scanning (Trivy, Grype)
* SBOM generation (Syft)
* Container signing & verification (cosign)

**Kubernetes Security:**

* RBAC least privilege
* NetworkPolicies (ingress/egress segmentation)
* Secure Secrets management
* Pod Security Standards (restricted baseline)
* Admission control & workload hardening
* kube-bench & kube-hunter scanning

**Supply Chain Security:**

* CI/CD integrated scanning
* Image signature enforcement
* Secure Helm chart development
* Artifact signing & provenance tracking

**AWS Security:**

* IRSA (IAM Roles for Service Accounts)
* ECR lifecycle & scanning policies
* ECS task role hardening
* EKS encryption at rest + OIDC
* Secure networking architectures (public/private subnets, SGs, NACLs)

**DevSecOps & Automation:**

* Security automation in pipelines
* Infrastructure-as-Code principles
* Zero Trust segmentation
* Secret rotation & least-privilege patterns

# 🏆 **Security Portfolio Projects**

### **Secure Cloud-Native Microservice Deployment**

Implemented a fully hardened cloud architecture using:

* AWS EKS cluster protected with RBAC, NetworkPolicies, and IRSA
* Signed & scanned container images stored in ECR
* End-to-end supply chain integrity with SBOMs and cosign
* Secure CI/CD pipeline enforcing vulnerability thresholds and artifact signing

**Security Outcomes:**
✔ Zero plaintext secrets
✔ Restricted pod permissions
✔ Isolated namespaces
✔ Verified container integrity before deployment

---

### **ECS Fargate Secure Deployment**

Built a containerized application deployed to AWS ECS with:

* Least-privilege task roles
* Secrets Manager for environment variables
* ECR scan-based deployment gating
* Hardened network perimeter using VPC segmentation

**Security Outcomes:**
✔ Eliminated sensitive data in images
✔ Enforced private network-only communication
✔ Automated vulnerability scanning before deployment

---

### **Kubernetes Cluster Security Assessment**

Performed a full cluster security audit using:

* kube-bench (CIS compliance)
* kube-hunter (penetration testing)
* Helm chart hardening
* PodSecurity admission enforcement

**Security Outcomes:**
✔ Mitigated critical CIS failures
✔ Implemented least-privilege identities
✔ Established egress controls and namespace isolation

# 📌 Want me to format this as a full resume page (PDF-ready)?

If yes, I can generate:

* A complete **one-page cybersecurity résumé**
* **Two-page detailed version**
* Or one tailored to **Cloud Security Engineer**, **DevSecOps**, or **Kubernetes Security Engineer** roles.

Just tell me which format you prefer.

And once you’re logged in, I can regenerate the **PNG architecture diagram** instantly.
