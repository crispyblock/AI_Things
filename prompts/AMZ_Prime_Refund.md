What you need to know about the settlement 

• Total settlement amount: Amazon is paying a total of $2.5 billion in a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) (https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/09/ftc-secures-historic-25-billion-settlement-against-amazon) to resolve allegations of misleading consumers into and around Amazon Prime subscriptions. 
• Refund amount: A portion of the settlement, $1.5 billion, is being used for customer refunds. 
• Eligibility for refunds: You may be eligible for a refund of up to $51 if you: 

	• Are a US-based Amazon Prime customer. 
	• Signed up for a Prime membership between June 23, 2019, and June 23, 2025, through a process the FTC challenged. 
	• Used fewer than three Prime benefits (like streaming videos or music) in any 12-month period after enrolling. 

• How to get your refund: 

	• Do nothing: Refunds are being sent automatically and you should not submit a claim form. 
	• Watch for an email: Eligible customers are receiving an email from Amazon starting around November 12, 2025, to claim their refund. 
	• Check the email source: Be cautious of scams. Legitimate refund emails will come directly from Amazon. The FTC also provides information on its website at ftc.gov/Amazon (https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/refunds/amazon-refunds). 

• Future changes: The settlement also requires Amazon to make changes to its Prime enrollment and cancellation process to make it more transparent and user-friendly. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
